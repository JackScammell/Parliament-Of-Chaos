# Summon the Council

Orchestrate specialists + grumpy reviewers for complex tasks. Iterate until all reviewers approve.

## Process

1. **Clarify goal** - Restate task, define "good" and "done"
2. **Select specialists** - Choose relevant agents from:
   - Review: grumpy-*, system-architect, security-knight
   - Implementation: backend-goblin, ui-ux-guru, data-warlock, test-prophet, api-keeper, doc-bard, package-wizard, resilience-tamer, pipeline-engineer, migration-monk, dependency-detective, refactor-ranger, config-curator, observability-oracle
   - Planning: project-oracle, scope-weaver, task-executor
3. **Delegate work** - Let specialists analyse/design/implement
4. **Grumpy review** - Run outputs through all 9 reviewers:
   - grumpy-code-reviewer, grumpy-standards-enforcer, grumpy-architecture-skeptic
   - grumpy-maintainability-curmudgeon, grumpy-security-nag, grumpy-performance-troll
   - grumpy-accessibility-auditor, grumpy-documentation-pedant, grumpy-testing-tyrant
5. **Iterate** - Route complaints back to specialists until grumps accept
6. **Synthesise** - Present final solution

## Output

- Summary of goal and approach
- Areas council focused on
- Final solution (code/recommendations)
- Trade-offs and caveats considered
